=== TileMatrixSet2D requirements class

Requirements class tilematrixset2D establishes how to describe a TileMatrixSet for a two-dimensional tile space. It is expected that tile matrix sets are defined once and that servers or encodings using or distributing tiles will declare the usage of a tile matrix set by linking to that tile matrix set. The identifying URI for this class is http://www.opengis.net/spec/tilematrixset/1.1/req/tilematrixset2d.

^a^    The multilingual scoping rules in <<multilingualTextEncoding>>>> apply.

^b^    CRS will be inherited from the supportedCRS parameter of the parent TileMatrixSet. The order of these axes shall be as specified by the supportedCRS. These are the precise coordinates of the top left corner of top left pixel of the 0,0 tile. See Figure 1.

^c^    This TileMatrix identifiers SHALL be unique (different) within the context of the parent TileMatrixSet. Many applications use a correlative numeric value as an identifier. Other alternatives are a rounded scale denominator or a rounded pixel size. It is recommended to avoid repeating the TileMatrixSet identifier as part of the TileMatrix identifier.

^d^    If no Title is specified, client may display the Identifier value instead.

^e^    In previous versions was called topLeftCorner and cornerOfOrigin did not exist

^f^    The pixel size of the tile can be obtained from the scaleDenominator by multiplying the later by 0.28 10-3 / metersPerUnit. If the CRS uses _meters_ as units of measure for the horizontal dimensions, then metersPerUnit=1; if it has degrees, then metersPerUnit=2p__a__/360 (_a_ is the Earth maximum radius of the ellipsoid).

NOTE: It may be desirable to define a tile matrix set with some general-scale tile matrices in one CRS (_e.g._, CRS:84) and with detailed-scale tile matrices in a different CRS (_e.g._, LCC projection). However, this standard does not allow mixing CRSs. Each tile matrix set declares a single CRS.

NOTE: The width (matrixWidth) and height (matrixHeith) in tiles of each tile matrix is explicitly given, so the range of relevant tile indexes does not have to be calculated by the client application.

NOTE: The bounding box of a tile matrix is not supplied explicitly because it can be calculated from cornerOfOrigin, pointOfOrigin, tileWidth, tileHeight and scaleDenominator.

[[tilesetmetadata2d-requirements-class]]
=== TileSetMetadata requirements class

Requirements class tilesetmetadata2d establishes how to describe TileSet Metadata for a two-dimensional tile space. The  tilesetmetadata2d data structure allows for a dataset declaring the use of a tile matrix set defined elsewhere and, if needed, a limited coverage for this tile matrix set, the list of geodata resources used to create the tileset and a recommended center point. Each TileSet in a dataset collection should declare the use of a tile matrix set using this data structure. The identifying URI for this class is http://www.opengis.net/spec/tilematrixset/1.1/req/tilesetmetadata2d.

include::requirements/REQ_tilesetmetadata2d_identifier.adoc[]

NOTE: To determine if two resources or datasets use the same TileMatrixSet, compare their TileMatrixSet identifier. Alternatively, compare TileMatrixSet definitions for an equivalency (a simple calculation can be performed to verify whether or not two given tile matrices are aligned).

NOTE: If the same TileMatrixSet is externally available in more than one format, it is recommended that the format selected is the closer to the original description document format. For example if a OGC API defines tiles using JSON, it is expected to link to a JSON definition of a TileMatrixSet.
