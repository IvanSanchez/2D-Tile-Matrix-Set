|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/tilematrixsetmetadata/identifier*
| Test Purpose | Validate that a tiled resource or dataset declares support to a tile matrix set by one of the following two methods: a link to a tile matrix set definition (e.g. one of the TileMatrixSet definitions from <<annex-common-tilematrixset-definitions-informative>> or <<annex-variable-tilematrixset-definitions-informative>>) as one of the links in the links list, or by explicitly including a TileMatrixSet definition (as an object in the `tileMatrixSet` property).
|Requirement |<<req_tilesetmetadata_identifier>>
| Test method | Validate the requirements of the model

Test passes if a tiled resource or dataset declares support to a tile matrix set by one of the following two methods: a link to a tile matrix set definition (including the TileMatrixSet definition from <<annex-common-tilematrixset-definitions-informative>> and <<annex-example-encodings-for-variable-matrix-width-informative>>) as one of the links in the links list or by explicitly including a TileMatrixSet definition (as an object in the `tileMatrixSet` property).
