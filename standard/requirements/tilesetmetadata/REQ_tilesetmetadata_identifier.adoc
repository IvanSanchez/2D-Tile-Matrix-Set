|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}|*/req/tilesetmetadata/identifier* {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
|A| A tiled resource or dataset SHALL declare support to a tile matrix set 2D by one of the following 3 methods: a link to a tile matrix set definition in the OGC NA definition service (including the TileMatrixSet definition from <<annex-common-tilematrixset-definitions-informative>> and <<annex-example-encodings-for-variable-matrix-width-informative>>) as a value of the `tileMatrixSetURI` property, by citing a tile matrix set URI defined in a service (as a value of the `tileMatrixSetDefinition` property) or by explicitly including a TileMatrixSet definition (as an object in the `tileMatrixSet` property). {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
|B| In an OGC API or an OGC Web Service and if the TileMatrixSet used is registered with the OGC NA definition service, `tileMatrixSetURI` SHALL be populated with a full URI to the OGC NA Definitions Server (an optional `tileMatrixSetDefinition` pointing to a local definition can also be provided) {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
|C| In an OGC API or an OGC Web Service and if the TileMatrixSet used is not registered with the OGC NA definition service, `tileMatrixSetDefinition` SHALL be populated with a definition URI available from the service (relative URIs are allowed) {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
|===

NOTE: The `tileMatrixSet` property with an object describing the TileMatrixSet is not intended for OGC APIs or OGC web services and it is included here for offline formats and encodings where links to resources are not possible or sensible.
