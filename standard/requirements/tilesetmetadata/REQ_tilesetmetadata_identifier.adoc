|A| A tiled resource or dataset SHALL declare support to a tile matrix set by one of the following two methods: a link to a tile matrix set definition (including the TileMatrixSet definition from <<annex-common-tilematrixset-definitions-informative>> and <<annex-example-encodings-for-variable-matrix-width-informative>>) as one of the links in the links list or by explicitly including a TileMatrixSet definition (as an object in the `tileMatrixSet` property). {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
|B| In an OGC API or an OGC Web Service and if the TileMatrixSet used is registered with the OGC NA definition service, `tileMatrixSetURI` SHALL be populated with a full URI to the OGC NA Definitions Server (an optional `tileMatrixSetDefinition` pointing to a local definition can also be provided) {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
|===

NOTE: The `tileMatrixSet` property with an object describing the TileMatrixSet is not intended for OGC APIs or OGC web services and it is included here for offline formats and encodings where links to resources are not possible or sensible.
