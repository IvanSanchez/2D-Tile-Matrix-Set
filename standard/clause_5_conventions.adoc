== Conventions

This section provides details and examples for any conventions used in the document.

[[identifiers]]
=== Identifiers

The normative provisions in this specification are denoted by the URI

http://www.opengis.net/spec/TileMatrixSet/2.0

All requirements and conformance tests that appear in this document are denoted by partial URIs which are relative to this base.

[[commonClasses]]
=== Common Classes

The following classes are extracted from the OWS Common 06-121r9. This way, the data structures presented in this document become independent from OWS Common and can be used in the emerging OGC APIs that depends on OGC API Commons (avoiding a conflicting dependency with the old OWS Common)

[[multilingualTextEncoding]]
==== Multilingual text encoding
Some text parameters specified with the data type CharacterString in UML are intended to have human-readable values, but not all humans can understand the same languages. This data class can be latter mapped to XML or JSON encodings.

The specified approach for allowing the language of a text value to be explicitly stated is indicated by the UML class diagram in the figure.

[#img_languagestring-uml-model,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.LanguageString UML model
image::figures/LanguageString.png[LanguageString UML model]

The value parameter specifies the human-language string, and the lang parameter specifies the language (in IETF RFC 4646 syntax) of the string. If a lang parameter is not present, then no language has been specified for the string unless specified by another means.

In case that multiple languages are necessary in a single document instance, the element that is of the LanguageString type should be a list with one entry for each _lang_ code.

NOTE: OGC APIs will use the language negotiation with HTTP headers. In this situation, it is expected that elements defined as a list of LanguageString will default into a single CharacterString that in JSON will default into a string data type. This does not preclude that in other environments the JSON encodings for language string can implement the LanguageString. In practice this means that a JSON schema for a LanguageString element should support both string and language string types.

==== Description, Title and Keywords
A basic set of data description parameters that includes human-readable title, abstract, and keywords is widely used in this standard and defined here as UML.

==== BoundingBox
A (basic) bounding box is one type of bounding box that is used in this document. The Bounding box data structure is specified in the following UML model and table.

The BoundingBox class describes a Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) surrounding a feature (in the broader sense), in the supported CRS.

A WGS 84 bounding box is another type of bounding box. This type is simplified from the basic bounding box data type for use only with the 2D geographic coordinate reference system which uses the WGS 84 geodetic datum, where longitude precedes latitude and both are recorded in decimal degrees.

4+| ^a^  Values other than the minimum and maximum may be used as discussed below.

^b^  The number of axes included, and the order of these axes, as specified by the referenced CRS.

^c^  This number is specified by the referenced CRS definition, but may also be specified here.
|===

The bounding box contents defined will not always specify the MINIMUM rectangular BOUNDING region, if the referenced CRS uses an Ellipsoidal, Spherical, Polar, or Cylindrical coordinate system, as those terms are specified in OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2. Specifically, this box will not specify the minimum rectangular bounding region surrounding a geometry whose set of points span the value discontinuity in an angular coordinate axis. Such axes include the longitude and latitude of Ellipsoidal and Spherical coordinate systems. That geometry could lie within a small region on the surface of the ellipsoid or sphere.

If the data for which a bounding box is needed is continuous around the continuous angular axis of an Ellipsoidal, Spherical, Polar, or Cylindrical coordinate system, the bounding box limits for that angular axis shall be set to minus and plus infinity.

==== CRSType

In this version of this standard we introduce the possibility define a CRS using a full description in addition to a reference to an external CRS catalogue. For descendent compatibility, CRSType can be defaulted as a URI but in here we extend it to a union of three possibilities.

==== WebLink

Many recent standards emphasize the usefulness of links as a way to relate a data structure instance to other data structures and make navigation through resources possible. Essential links are make explicit in the data structures of this document (recognizable by a URI data type) but other links can be added as needed for convenience when an WebLink is available. The data structure defined here allows the addition of other links. The definition is based on the web linking defined in the RFC8288 and the XML serialization present in section 4.2.7 of the RFC4287 and in the JSON serialization found in this IETF draft: https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-pot-json-link-01.html

NOTE: In practice, some encodings can opt to specify the essential links as part of this data structure for convenience

^b^ It should be a media type format as specified in section 4.2 of rfc6838

^c^ As specified in RFC5646
