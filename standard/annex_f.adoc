== Example encodings for Common TileMatrixSets (Informative)

This Annex provides examples of JSON and XML encodings than can be used to define tile matrix sets.

=== JSON schema used to validate the JSON examples provided
The TileMatrixSet data structure has been transformed into JSON schemes as described in section <<tilematrixset-encodings>> and provided with this standard as indicated in <<annex-schema-documents-normative>>. JSON document instances describing TileMatrixSets (including the ones reproduced in this annex) should validate against these schemes. The following JSON Schema fragment reproduces the main module of the TileMatrixSet schema.

[source,json]
....
include::../schemas/tms/2.0/json/tileMatrixSet.json[]
....

=== XML schema used to validate the XML examples document

The TileMatrixSet data structure has been transformed into XSD schemes as described in section <<tilematrixset-encodings>> and provided with this standard as indicated in <<annex-schema-documents-normative>>. XML document instances describing TileMatrixSets (including the ones reproduced in this annex) should validate against these schemes. The following XML Schema fragment reproduces the main module of the TileMatrixSet schema.

=== Web Mercator Quad

These are the JSON and XML definitions of the WebMercatorQuad tile matrix set (see <<web-mercator-quad-tilematrixset-definition-httpwww.opengis.netdeftilematrixsetogc1.0webmercatorquad>>) that can be reproduced by other standards needing to define a tile matrix set. Not all TileMatrix elements need to be included and including other TileMatrices for more detailed scales is possible if they follow the same pattern.

One can define an arbitrary number of zoom levels. Here, 25 zoom levels are illustrated.

=== World WGS84 Quad

*Variant 1: World CRS84 Quad (recommended)*

These are the JSON and XML definitions of the WorldCRS84Quad tile matrix set (see <<world-crs84-quad-tilematrixset-definition-httpwww.opengis.netdeftilematrixsetogc1.0worldcrs84quad>>) that can be reproduced by other standards needing to define a tile matrix set. Not all TileMatrix elements need to be included and including other TileMatrices for more detailed scales is possible if they follow the same pattern.

One can define an arbitrary number of zoom levels. Here, 23 zoom levels are illustrated.

These are the JSON and XML definitions of the WorldMercatorQuad tile matrix set (see <<world-mercator-wgs84-quad-tilematrixset-definition-httpwww.opengis.netdeftilematrixsetogc1.0worldmercatorwgs84quad>>) that can be reproduced by other standards needing to define a tile matrix set. Not all TileMatrix elements need to be included and including other TileMatrices for more detailed scales is possible if they follow the same pattern.

One can define an arbitrary number of zoom levels. Here, 19 zoom levels are illustrated but resolutions up to 24 are currently available in some mass market services.

=== Universal Transverse Mercator WGS84 Quad for zone 31

These are the JSON and XML definitions of the UTM31WGS84Quad tile matrix set (see <<universal-transverse-mercator-wgs84-quad-family-tilematrixset-definition-httpwww.opengis.netdeftilematrixsetogc1.0utmwgs84quad>>) that can be reproduced by other standards needing to define a tile matrix set if the zone 31 is required. The other 59 zones in the 60 UTM partition can be defined similarly. Not all TileMatrix elements need to be included and including other TileMatrices for more detailed scales is possible if they follow the same pattern.
