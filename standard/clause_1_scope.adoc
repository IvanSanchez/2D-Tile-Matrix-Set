== Scope

This OGC Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set (TMS) and Tile Set Matadata Standard specifies the concepts of a tile matrix set and tile set metadata, prioritizing their implementation in 2D space. There are also some considerations on how to extend the TMS concept to nD. This Standard also provides both XML and JSON encodings.

The Tile Matrix Set concept, initially developed as part of the OGC Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) 1.0 Standard, is now provided as an independent standard that can be referenced by other standards such as _OGC API - Tiles_, _OGC GeoPackage_, _OGC CDB_, or the Natural Resources Canada (NRCan)-promoted specification _Map Markup Language (MapML)_. In addition, the OGC Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set (TMS) and Tile Set Matadata Standard ensures that the TMS concept can be used to structure both gridded as well as vector data in a tiled format.

This Standard also contains an informative annex for <<annex-common-tilematrixset-definitions-informative>> with a library of proposed tile matrix set definitions for Mercator, Transverse Mercator, Polar Stereographic, Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area, and Lambert Conformal Conic.
An additional annex for <<annex-variable-tilematrixset-definitions-informative>> provides tile matrix set definitions, utilizing the variable width capabilities of this standard, which allows for roughly approximate equal area tiles for Plate Carr√©e projections.

Global identifiers for the Tile Matrix Sets defined in these annexes are registered with an OGC register of official definitions called the OGC Naming Authority in the http://www.opengis.net/def/tms[Tile Matrix Set Register].

The Tile Set Metadata provides information about the intended use of a Tile Set as well as the origin, access contraints, tiling scheme, layers and feature properties contained within. A tile set is a series of tiles containing data and following a common tiling scheme. Tile Set Metadata is intended to facilitate retrieval of tile sets and describes the major characteristics of tile sets without either accessing the tiles or the content within a tile. The Tile Set Metadata was initially developed in phase two of the OGC Vector Tiles Pilot (https://www.ogc.org/vectortiles2) and te results documented in [OGC 19-082r1] OGC Vector Tiles Pilot 2: Tile Set Metadata Engineering Report.

NOTE: A previous version of this standard had a JSON-LD encoding of the classes presented in <<tilematrixset-model>>. This encoding was abandoned and not included in this version as no interest was detected.
