== Scope

This document specifies the concepts of a tile matrix set and tile matrix set limits and their implementation in 2D space. This standard also provides both a XML and a JSON encoding. The Tile Matrix Set concept, initially developed in OGC Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) 1.0, is now provided as an independent standard that can be referenced by other standards such as WMTS 2.0 and GeoPackage, or the Natural Resources Canada (NRCan)-promoted specification Map Markup Language (MapML). In addition, this standard ensures that the tile matrix set concept can be used by grid based tiles as well as for vector tiles. This document also contains an informative Annex D with a library of proposed tile matrix set definitions for Mercator, Transverse Mercator, Polar Stereographic, Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area, and Lambert Conformal Conic. Global identifiers for the Tile Matrix Sets in the Annex D will be agreed with the OGC Naming Authority.
