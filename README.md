# Revision of the OGC Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set

This GitHub repository contains the draft content for the revision of the OGC 17-083r2 Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set standard.

The repo is organized as follows:

* index.adoc - nothing in this document
* standard - the main standard document content
  - organized in multiple sections and directories
  - this is the only part needed to create a standard

There are several issues collected since the publication of the standard that will be solved. The process is done in parallel with the OGC API Tiles Part 1: https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-API-Tiles
