		<documentation>This XML Schema Document encodes the parts of the
    MD_DataIdentification class of ISO 19115 (OGC Abstract Specification Topic
    11) which are expected to be used for most datasets. This Schema also
    encodes the parts of this class that are expected to be useful for other
    metadata. Both may be used within the Contents section of OWS service
    metadata (Capabilities) documents.

		<annotation>
			<documentation>Position instances hold the coordinates of a position in
      a coordinate reference system (CRS) referenced by the related "crs"
      attribute or elsewhere. For an angular coordinate axis that is
      physically continuous for multiple revolutions, but whose recorded
      values can be discontinuous, special conditions apply when the bounding
      box is continuous across the value discontinuity: a) If the bounding box
      is continuous clear around this angular axis, then ordinate values of
      minus and plus infinity shall be used. b) If the bounding box is
      continuous across the value discontinuity but is not continuous clear
      around this angular axis, then some non-normal value can be used if
      specified for a specific OWS use of the BoundingBoxType. For more
      information, see Subclauses 10.2.5 and C.13.</documentation>
