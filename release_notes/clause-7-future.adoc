[[Clause_FutureWork]]
== Future Work
The future work will now focus on leveraging the concepts and encodings of TileMatrixSets and TileSet metadata defined in this standard as the basis for the OGC API - Tiles specification. We do not expect immediate changes to this standard in the near future. However the need for harmonization with other approaches for multidimensional tiles has been detected.
//OPTIONAL: Describe any Change Requests or Issues which are planned to be addressed in a future version of the Standard.
